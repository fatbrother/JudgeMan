The function prototype is as follows.1 int value(int type, int width, int height, int length); The value of a metal block is determined by its type, width, height, and length. We have six types of metals: gold, silver, copper, lead, iron, and titanium. The unit price of these metals are 30,10,4,5,3,9 respectively. A block must be cut into cubes of the same dimension before it can be sold, and no material should be left after cutting. For example, a 4 by 8 by 2 block can only be sold in 2 by 2 by 2 or 1 by 1 by 1 cubes. However, the price of a cubic is equal to the square of its volume multiplied by the unit price. As a result, the price of a 2 by 2 by 2 gold cubic is 8\u00d78\u00d730=1920, and the maximum value of a 4 by 8 by 2 gold block is therefore 1920\u00d78=15360. Now given the type, width, height, and length of a block, determine its maximum value. Input The type parameter indicates the type of the metal block. If the type is 79, then the metal is gold. The rest are 47,29,82,26,22, for silver, copper, lead, iron, and titanium. The width, height, and length are the dimensions of the block. Output You need to check the input type. If the input type is not a valid metal code, you must return -1. Then you need to check the dimension. The width, height, and length all fit into an int.

If it is, you need to compute the fine. First you need to determine if the book is overdue. For this you need the \"type\" information. For NOVEL the maximum allowed period for borrowing a book is 90 days. For COMICS, MANUAL, TEXTBOOK, it is 10, 100, and 5 days respectively. Note that if you borrowed a book on 2007/11/14, and returned it on 2007/12/3, then you'd borrowed it for 20 days. Even if you borrowed and return a book at the same day, it is counted as one day. If you borrowed a NOVEL for 100 days, then it is 10 days overdue. It is guaranteed that the returned date will not be earlier than the borrowed date, and the year is between 1000 and 3000 inclusively. After you have determined whether a book is overdue, next you need to determine the fine. The fine is determined by two factors -- how many days are overdue and the importance of the book. Unfortunately the importance of a book is encoded in an unsigned integer in a very strange way. The importance value contains exactly two '1'-bits in its binary representation, and the importance factor is the distance between the two '1'-bits, i.e. the number of '0'-bits between them. The fine is equal to the product of the importance factor and the day of overdue. For example, if the importance is 17 (whose binary representation is 00000000000000000000000000010001) and the book is overdue for 10 days, then the library fine is 30. \u6bcf\u4e00\u672c\u66f8\u90fd\u6709\u5176\u9810\u5b9a\u7684\u51fa\u79df\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u82e5\u5728\u898f\u5b9a\u6642\u9593\u5167\u6b78\u9084\uff0c\u5247\u4e0d\u7b97\u4efb\u4f55\u8cbb\u7528\u3002\u5982\u5c0f\u8aaa NOVEL \u5728 90 \u5929\u5167 (\u542b) \u4e0d\u8a08\u7b97\u4efb\u4f55\u8cbb\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u7406\u6f2b\u756b COMIC 10 \u5929\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u8aaa\u660e\u66f8 MANUAL 100 \u5929\u3001\u6559\u79d1\u66f8 TEXTBOOK 5 \u5929\u3002\u5982\u679c\u8d85\u51fa\u898f\u5b9a\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u5247\u9700\u8981\u7e73\u4ea4\u984d\u5916\u7684\u7f70\u6b3e\uff0c\u6bcf\u665a\u4e00\u5929\u5c31\u5fc5\u9808\u591a\u4ed8 X \u5143\uff0cX \u53d6\u6c7a\u65bc importance \u8f49\u6210\u4e8c\u9032\u5236\u7684\u5169\u500b 1-bit \u4f4d\u7f6e\u8ddd\u96e2\u3002 \u7d66\u5b9a\u66f8\u7c4d\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3001\u501f\u51fa\u65e5\u671f borrowed_date \u548c\u6b78\u9084\u65e5\u671f returned_date\uff0c\u8acb\u64b0\u5beb\u4e00\u500b\u51fd\u6578\u8a08\u7b97\u51fa\u79df\u8cbb\u7528\u3002 Notes You only need to submit your library_fine function.

Both will move at the speed of one square per time step. The first robot carries F1 amount of fuel and the second robot carries F2. If a robot runs out of fuel, it will stop at that square. Moving to a new square requires one unit of fuel. During the first N1 time steps, the first robot R1 will move to the north; then, it will move towards the east during the next E1 time steps. The first robot will repeat this pattern until it runs out of fuel. The second robot R2 will move a little bit differently. During the first E2 time steps, the second robot R2 will move to the east; then, it will move towards the north during the next N2 time steps. Again the second robot will repeat this pattern until it runs out of fuel. If either robot moves \"out of bound,\" it will \"wrap around\" and reappear (by sort of magic) on the other side of the field. For example, if M=7 and N=6 and a robot at (5,5) goes north, it will reappear at (5,0). In addition, if two robots move into the same square, they explode. Now given the starting position of the first robot at (X1,Y1), and the second robot at (X2,Y2), and the amount of fuel they carry (F1 and F2), determine whether the two robots will explode or not.

There are n parking lots for these illegally parked bicycles. The i-th parking lot is located at (xi,yi) and has a capacity of ci bicycles. The university moves an illegally parked bicycle to the nearest parking lot. The distance between a bicycle and a parking lot is the sum of their absolute value in x and y coordinates. For example, the distance between (1,3) and (\u22122,2) is 3+1=4. If there are two nearest parking lots, we choose the one with a smaller x coordinate. If the x coordinates are the same, we choose the one with a smaller y coordinate. If all nearest parking lots are full, that is, already have their capacity of bicycles, we move the bicycle to one of the second nearest parking lots, and so on. We assume that the total capacity of all parking lots is sufficient for all illegally parked bicycles. Given the locations and capacity of all parking lots, please determine the parking lots a sequence of illegally parked bicycles will go to. Input The first line of the input is the number of parking lots n. Each of the following n lines has the x, y coordinate, and the capacity of a parking lot. The next line has an integer m, the number of illegally parked bicycles. Each of the next m lines has the x and y coordinates of the bicycle. We move the bicycles according to the order in the input. Output The output has n lines. The i-th line is the number of bicycles in the i-th parking lots after moving all m bicycles to the parking lots. Bounds n is positive and no more than 10. m is positive and no more than 100000. The x and y coordinates are all between -10000 and 10000.",

Professor P decides to give the students the 0-100 grades as usual, but he needs a program to convert the 0-100 grades and compute the average. This program will read grades from stdin until EOF, prints each grade, and compute the average. However, professor P expects that this program will behave differently. If a #define HUNDRED is defined, this program will behave like before. The program will print all grades, then compute the average grade using integer arithmetic. On the other hand, if a #define APLUS is defined. This program will behave very differently. First every grade will be converted to a rank from A+ to F. Each rank has a corresponding grade between 0 and 4.3, which we will define as rank grade. You program will then compute the average rank grade. Finally, each rank has another 0-100 grade, which we will define as 100 grade. You will compute the average 100 grade as well. grade rank rank grade 100 grade90-100 A+ 4.3 9585-89 A 4.0 8780-84 A- 3.7 8277-79 B+ 3.3 7873-76 B 3.0 7570-72 B- 2.7 7067-69 C+ 2.3 6863-66 C 2.0 6560-62 C- 1.7 600-59 F 0 50",

The initial positions of these two balls are different and given as (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) respectively, and 1<x1,x2<X, 1<y1,y2<Y. The moving direction of these balls are given as (dx1,dy1) and (dx2,dy2). The balls move 1 unit at a second and they always move in 45 degree angle, therefore all dx and dy are either 1 or \u22121. For example, suppose (x1,y1) is (3,4) and (dx1,dy1) is (\u22121,1) then after one second the first ball will move to (2,5). The ball will bounce when it hits the wall of the box. Since the ball always moves in 45 degree angle, it is easy to compute its path. For example, suppose (x1,y1) is (2,4) and (dx1,dy1) is (\u22121,1) then the position of the first ball is (2,4),(1,5),(2,6),... etc. If the ball hits a corner, it bounces back the way it came in. The balls may hit each other and bounce back. We determine if two balls hit into each other by checking whether their positions are the same after they move into their new locations. For example, suppose (x1,y1) is (3,4) and (dx1,dy1) is (\u22121,1), and (x2,y2) is (3,6) and (dx1,dy1) is (\u22121,\u22121), The first ball will go to (3,4),(2,5),(1,4), ... and the second ball will go to (3,6),(2,5),(1,6), ..., etc. Note that by our rules two balls exchanging positions do not collide. I know this is against physics but I do not want to make this problem complicated, so bear with me.

        "description": " Write a program to simulate shuffling a deck of cards. We will use an array of pointers to represent a deck of card. A card is an integer from 1 to 10000, and the i-th element of this array represent the i-th card in a deck of cards. That is, if the i-th card in the deck is 6, then the i-th pointer in the pointer will point to an integer whose value is 6. If a pointer has NULL then it is the end of deck, and there are no more cards after it, so it is like an \"end of deck\". We also assume that there will be no more than 9999 cards in a deck. Now we want to shuffle a deck of cards. First we cut the deck into two halves. The first half has the first ceil(n/2) cards and the second half has the remaining cards. For example, if there are 9 cards then the first half has 5 cards and the second half has 4 cards. Then we shuffle these two halves into one by placing the first card from the first half as the first card, the first card from the second half as the second card, the second card from the first half as the third card, etc. That is, we interleave these two halves back into a deck of cards. The prototype of this shuffling function is as follows.1 void shuffle(int *deck[]); We also need to be able to print a deck of cards. For this we need the following print_deck function, which will print the cards according to their order in the deck in a single line, with a space between two cards. Note that you will know there are no more cards by the \"end of deck\".1 void print(int *deck[]); A sample main program is as follows. Please finish the program by providing the implementation of shuffle and print.123456789101112131415161718#include <stdio.h>#include \"card.h\"int main(){int card[10000];int *deck[10000];int index = 0;while (scanf(\"%d\", &(card[index])) != EOF) {deck[index] = &(card[index]);index++;}deck[index] = NULL;shuffle(deck);print(deck);return 0;}",

The previous program should produce the following output. Initially the entire memory is free so the only free block starts from 0 and is of length 100. After the first allocation starting at 50 and of length 10, there will be two free blocks now -- one starts at 0 with length 50, and the other starts at 60 with length 40. The memory allocation continues so your memory object should record what memory blocks are still free, so that the prtintMemory can print them correctly.========== start 0, length 100========== start 0, length 50 start 60, length 40========== start 0, length 50 start 60, length 10 start 80, length 20========== start 10, length 40 start 60, length 10 start 80, length 20========== start 10, length 20 start 40, length 10 start 60, length 10 start 80, length 20 I strongly suggest using a linked list to record the free memory blocks. Whenever we have a memory allocations, we can traverse the list, find the necessary block to update. Note that you may need to insert a new free memory block because one might allocate in the middle of a block. You also need to remove a free block since it may be allocated completely. You need to implement the following functions:123 void initMemory(Memory *memory, int length); void printMemory(Memory *memory); void allocateMemory(Memory *memory, int start, int length); The bonus problem is to extend the previous memory object so that it supports free function. This function will release a memory block. void freeMemory(Memory *memory, int start, int length);0\u2264start<start+length\u2264n The main program may look like this now: main.c123456789101112131415161718192021222324#include \"memory.h\"int main() {Memory myMemory;initMemory(&myMemory, 100);printMemory(&myMemory);allocateMemory(&myMemory, 50, 10);printMemory(&myMemory);allocateMemory(&myMemory, 70, 10);printMemory(&myMemory);allocateMemory(&myMemory, 0, 10);printMemory(&myMemory);allocateMemory(&myMemory, 30, 10);printMemory(&myMemory);freeMemory(&myMemory, 50, 5);printMemory(&myMemory);freeMemory(&myMemory, 70, 10);printMemory(&myMemory);freeMemory(&myMemory, 30, 10);printMemory(&myMemory);freeMemory(&myMemory, 0, 10);printMemory(&myMemory);return 0;} Now the output should be like this.========== start 0, length 100========== start 0, length 50 start 60, length 40========== start 0, length 50 start 60, length 10 start 80, length 20========== start 10, length 40 start 60, length 10 start 80, length 20========== start 10, length 20 start 40, length 10 start 60, length 10 start 80, length 20========== start 10, length 20 start 40, length 15 start 60, length 10 start 80, length 20========== start 10, length 20 start 40, length 15 start 60, length 40========== start 10, length 45 start 60, length 40========== start 0, length 55 start 60, length 40 You need to implement the additional function:1 void freeMemory(Memory *memory, int start, int length); Notice: In order to avoid linking error, you do have to implement freeMemory even if you don't want to get the bonus points.
