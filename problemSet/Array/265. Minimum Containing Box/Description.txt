Task Description
Write a program to find the area of the minimum rectangle (with edges parallel to the axes) to contain a set of points. For example, if you are given the following points (1,1), (2,3), (7,6), (−2,7), (−4,20), (0,0), (−3,−3), then the smallest rectangle to contain all the points is the one that has two corners at (−4,−3) and (7,20). You need to print its area, which is 253.
Input
You must process all input until EOF. There will be no more than 100 points, and all computation is in int. All coordinates are between -10000 and 10000, and there will be at least one point.
Output
The final area.
