Task Description
Write a program to simulate a Pachinko. For this problem, we will use a very simple pachinko. There are N
rows of pins in this pachinko. The i
-th pin of a row is between the i
-th and (i−1)
-th pin in the previous row, as shown in the figure below. When a ball drops on a pin, it will go either left or right. This probability varies from pin to pin. After hitting N
pins, the ball will fall into one of the N+1
buckets. After knowing the probability of going left or right for every pin, compute the probability that a ball falls into each N+1
bucket.
The number of rows of pins N
is less than or equal to 15
.

Input
The first line of the input has the number of rows N
. The next N(N+1)/2
line has two integers a
, b
, that indicate the ratio of the probability that the ball will go left or right. The probability ratio is given from top to bottom, from left to right. a,b≥0
, and it is guaranteed that one of a,b>0
.
Output
Please output N+1
lines -- each has a fractional number. The i
-line has the probability of the ball falling into the i
-th bucket. Each line has a ratio of q/p
to indicate the probability. You need to simplify the q/p
ratio; you should output 1/2
instead of 2/4
.
Sample input
2
1 2
2 3
3 1
Sample output
2/15
7/10
1/6
Hint
In order to prevent arithmetic overflow, you should reduce the denominator and numerator of each fractional number you use.
