Task Description
Write a function to determine the number and types of intersections in a city. We use a n
by n
integer array to represent a city. A one in the array indicates a road, and a zero in the array indicates a building. There are four kinds of intersection of roads.
A cell is an intersection if it is one, and all of its four neighbors are also one.
A cell is a T-junction if it is 1
and exactly three of its neighbors are 1
.
A cell is a turn if it is 1
and exactly two of its neighbors are 1
, and these two neighbors do not form a straight line that goes through the cell.
A cell is a dead end if it is 1
, and exactly one of its neighbors is 1
. Now given the matrix, please compute the number of intersections, T
-junctions, turns and dead ends.
Limits
n
is no more than 100
.
Input Format
There are n+1
lines in the input. The first line has n
. Each of the next lines has n
integers. These integers are either 0
or 1
.
Output Format
There are four lines in the output. These four lines has the number of intersections, T-junctions, turns and dead ends, respectively.
