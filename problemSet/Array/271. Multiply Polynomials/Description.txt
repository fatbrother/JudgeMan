Task Description
Write a program to multiply two polynomials. We will represent a polynomial by a sequence of its coefficients. For example, we will use (1,2,3) to represent x2+2x+3, and (4,5,6,7) for 4x3+5x2+6x+7.
Limits
The number of coefficients in a polynomial is no more than 100. The coefficients are positive and no more than 100.
Input
There are four lines in the input. The first line is a positive integer n, the number of coefficients of the first polynomial f(x). The second line has m integers for the coefficients of the second polynomial g(x). Similarly, the third line and fourth line are for the second polynomial.
Output
The output is the coefficients of the product of the two input polynomials f(x)g(x).
