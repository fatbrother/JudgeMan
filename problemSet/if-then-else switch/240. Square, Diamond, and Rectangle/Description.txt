Task Description
Given four different points on the plane, determine the shape of this polygon. There are several cases.
If the length of the four sides are the same, and the four angles are right, then it is a square. For example, the polygon by (−1,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,−1) is a square.
If the length of the four sides are the same, but the four angles are not right angle, then it is a diamond. For example, polygon by (−2,0),(0,1),(2,0),(0,−1) is a diamond.
If the length of the four sides are not the same, but the four angles are right angle, then it is a rectangle. For example, polygon by (0,0),(0,1),(2,1),(2,0) is a rectangle.
給定平面上四個點，它們彼此不共點，請判斷這個多邊形的形狀，有以下三種可能：
如果四邊長度相同以及角度為直角，它們即是正方形，如多邊形 (−1,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,−1) 就是個正方形。
如果四邊長度相同但角度不是直角，它們即是菱形，如多邊形 (−2,0),(0,1),(2,0),(0,−1) 就是個菱形。
如果四邊長度不同且四個角均是直角，它們即是長方形，如 (0,0),(0,1),(2,1),(2,0) 就是個長方形。
不屬於上述三者，請回報 other
Input
The first line has the number of test data n. n is at least 1 and at most 100000. Each of he next n line has a test data. Each test data line has 8 integers for the four points.
The first two are the x and y coordinates of the first point, etc.
Since the difference between two x coordinates, or two y coordinates is bounded by 10000, you may assume that the computation can be safely done with int.
It is also guaranteed that there will be no three points in a straight line, and the quadrilateral is convex and unique. The four points may be given in any order.
Output
Output the shape for each input line. You should output square, diamond, rectangle according to the definition above. If the polygon does not fit into any definition, output other.
Sample input
4
-1 0 0 -1 0 1 1 0
-2 0 2 0 0 -1 0 1
0 1 2 1 0 0 2 0
0 1 0 0 2 1 2 -10
Sample output
square
diamond
rectangle
other
Hint
You can easily check whether an angle is a right angle by Pythagorean theorem - a2+b2=c2.
你可以使用向量外積的正負號，讓輸入的點按照順或逆時針的方式排列。
