Task Description
Write a program to calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for two mixed fractions. You will be given two mixed fractions -- a
b
c
and e
f
g
. For example, if a=1
, b=3
, and c=4
, then you have 1.75. You can also represent negative number by a negative a
, so if a=âˆ’1
, b=3
, and c=4
, then the result is -1.75. For simplicity we assume that a
and e
are always non-zero, b
and f
are always non-negative, and c
and g
are always positive. Also, b
and c
have to be simplified. For example, you cannot have a=1
, b=6
, and c=8
. Also when b
or f
is 0, c
and g
must be 1. We will be given an extra number d
as the operator. If d
is 0, 1, 2, 3, then the operation is addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. Now given a,b,c,d,e,f,g
, compute the final result as a mixed fraction h
i
j
.
Limits
The ranges of numbers are as follow. a
and e
are non-zero and between -100 and 100 inclusively. b
, and f
are non-negative and no more than 100. c
and g
are positive and no more than 100. d
is always between 0 and 3 inclusively.
Input
a,b,c,d,e,f,g
Output
The output follows the same rules as the input. You should output h
, i
, and j
in three lines.
