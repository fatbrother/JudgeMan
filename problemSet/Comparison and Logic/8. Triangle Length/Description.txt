Task Description
Write a program to print 1 if the three positive integers a
, b
, and c
are valid lengths of a triangle; print 0 otherwise. We can verify the condition by assuring that all a
, b
, and c
are positive, and the sum of any two of them is greater than the third.
給三個整數 a,;b,;c
分別代表三角形的邊長。如果能拼成一個三角形，輸出 1，反之輸出 0。判斷三角形是否合法：任兩個邊長和大於第三邊。
Input Format
There are three lines in the input. The first line has the integer a
, the second line has the integer b
, and the third line has the integer c
.
Output Format
There is one line in the output. The line has 1 if the lengths are valid, 0 otherwise.
