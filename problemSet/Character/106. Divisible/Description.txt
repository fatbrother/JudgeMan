Task Description
Write a program to determine if a number is divisible by 2,3,5
, and 11
. The rules are as follow.
A number is divisible by 2
if the last digit is divisible by 2
.
A number is divisible by 3
if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3
.
A number is divisible by 5
if the last digit is 0
or 5
.
A number is divisible by 11
if the difference between the sum of the even positioned digits and the the sum of the odd positioned digits is divisible by 11
.
For example the number 190949
is not divisible by 2
because 9
is not divisible by 2
. It is not divisible by 3
because 1+9+0+9+4+9=32
is not divisible by 3
. It is not divisible by 5
because the last digit is 9
. It is divisible by 11
because the sum of even positioned digits is 9+9+9=27
, and the the sum of odd positioned digits is 1+0+4=5
. The difference between 27
and 5
is 22
, which is divisible by 11
.
Limits
The number of digits in a number is no more than 1000
. Note that the number of digits could be very large so you cannot store the number in an int.
Input
The input has several lines. Each line has a positive integer. A -1 indicates the end of input.
Output
For each input number your program should output four yes or no, which are separated by a space character. These yes and no indicate whether the input number is divisible by 2,3,5
, and 11
.
Sample input
190949
20
-1
Sample output
no no no yes
yes no yes no
