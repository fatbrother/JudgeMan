Task Description
Write a program to count the number of ways to pick at least k
number out of N
positive numbers so that the sum of the picked numbers is no more than M
.
For example, given four numbers 1
, 3
, 5
, and 7
, then there are 6
ways to pick at least 2
numbers so that their sum is no more than 10
. The solutions are {1,3},{1,5},{1,7},{3,5},{3,7}
, and {1,3,5}
.
Input Format
The first line contains three integers: k
, N
and M
, where 1≤k≤N
, 1≤N≤20
, and 1≤M≤5000000
. The second line contains N
positive integers; each of them is smaller than 100000
.
Output Format
The number of ways to pick at least k
number out of N
positive numbers so that the sum of the picked numbers is no more than M
.
