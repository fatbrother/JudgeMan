Task Description
Write a program to recognize lakes. We are given a N
by M
picture, and each pixel indicates whether that cell is land or water. A lake is defined as a set of water cells that are connected. Two cells are connected if they have the same x
coordinate, and their y
coordinates differ by exactly 1, or they have the same y
coordinate, and their x
coordinates differ by exactly 1. The size of a lake is the number of water cells in it.
Input
There first line of input has N
and M
(1≤N,M≤400
), the dimension of the picture. Each of the next N
line has M
numbers. A 1 indicates a water cell and a 0 indicates a land cell.
Output
The out has L
lines, where L
is the number of lakes in the picture, which is at most N⋅M/2+1
. The i
-th line has the size of i
-th largest lake.

我環顧四週，追尋流水的方向， 我雖不能像上帝一樣，在水面行走， 但是我思念的腳步，卻沒有不能到達的地方， 因為這一步，這一生的結束， 就是下一步，下一世的開始。
