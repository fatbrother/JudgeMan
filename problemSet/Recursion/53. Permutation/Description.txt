Task Description
Write a program to output all permutations of N
numbers. The permutations must be outputted in sorted order according to the first number, then the second number, and so on.
Input Format
The first line of the input gives the integer N
(0<Nâ‰¤9
). The second line contains N
numbers separated in a space to be processed. The N
numbers are guaranteed to be distinct.
Output Format
The output should be consisted of M
lines where M
is the number of different permutations of the given N
numbers. Each line consists of N
numbers separated by a space representing a unique permutation. Be aware of the order of those permutations.

Hint
Suppose we have 4 numbers, 10, 20, 30, and 40. The problem of finding all the permutations of these 4 numbers can be divided into four smaller problems. The first problem is to find all the permutations of 20, 30, and 40, then place a 10 in front of each one of the permutations found. Similarly we can place a 20 in front of all permutations of 10, 30, and 40, a 30 in front of all permutations of 10, 20, and 40, and a 40 in front of all permutations of 10, 20, and 30. These are the permutations we are looking for.
