Task Description
Write a program to determine whether we can use up all materials in making goods. There are three kinds of materials A
, B
, and C
, and there are also three kinds of good, D
, E
, and F
. To make a D
we need DA
units of material A
, DB
units of material B
, and DC
units of materials C
. Similarly for E
we need EA
, EB
and EC
units of materials A
, B
, C
, and for F
we need FA
, FB
, and FC
units of materials A
, B
, and C
. Now given the units of materials A
, B
, and C
available, could we make goods D
, E
and F
, and use up ALL materials? Note that we do not need to make every kind of goods.
Input
The first line of the input has DA
, DB
, and DC
. The second line of the input has EA
, EB
, and EC
, and the third line has FA
, FB
, and FC
. Then the next line has n
, the number of test cases. Each test case has a
, b
, and c
in a line, as the units of available material A
, B
and C
in this test case. All numbers are integers between 1
and 10
.
Output
The output has n
lines. If in a test case we can use up all materials, then output "yes\n". Otherwise output "no\n".

Hint
Could you use recursion to transform this problem in to many smaller and similar problems?
Limitation
In this problem, the use of keyword for, while, goto, are forbidden.
