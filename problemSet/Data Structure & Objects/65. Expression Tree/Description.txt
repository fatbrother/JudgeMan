Problem Description
Write a program to compute an expression using a tree. Consider the expression 4 + x * 7. We will use the following recursive definition to express this expression tree.
A positive integer or a variable is an expression tree.
( operator left-tree right-tree ) is also an expression tree if operator is one of the '+', '-', '*', or '/', and both left-tree and right-tree are expression trees.
Following this definition, we can use ( + 4 ( * x 7 ) ) to denote the previous expression. Now given an expression tree and the values of all variables, compute the value of this expression.
Input
The first line of the input is the expression tree, which is less than 1000 characters. Note that every two adjacent elements of an expression tree are separated by a space. The name of the variables are valid C variable names, with no more than 32 characters. The next n
lines (n≤50
), where n
is the number of variables in the expression tree, indicates the value of the variable, in a form as variable = v, also separated by a space.
Output
The output is the value of the expression tree.
Sample input
( + 4 ( * x 7 ) )
x = 5
Sample output
39
Hint
C 語言變數命名規則
採用英文二十六的大小寫字母為主 ('a-z', 'A-Z')，另加上數字 '0-9'、底線符號 '_' 及金錢符號 '$'
不以數字開頭
