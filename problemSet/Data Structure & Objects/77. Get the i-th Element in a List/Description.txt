Task Description
Now you have a linked list, write a function to get the i
-th element in this list. The function has the following prototype:
struct node *getNode(struct node *head, unsigned int i);
You only need to implement this function. This function will return a pointer that points to the i
-th element in the linked list, with i=0
being the last element and the indices are counted in reverse order. If i
is too large for the list, you should return NULL. The list won't be empty, and the last node's pointer next will point to NULL.
Please include this line #include "node.h" when submitting.
The content in node.h is like the following:

#ifndef _NODE_H
#define _NODE_H
 struct node {
       struct node *next;
};
 #endif
