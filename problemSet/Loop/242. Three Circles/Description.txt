Task Description
You are given three circles, C1,C2
, and C3
. The center of C1
is at (x1,y1)
, and its radius is r1
. The centers and radius of C2
and C3
are defined similarly. A point (x,y)
is within a circle if its distance is less than or equal to the radius of the circle. For example, Both (1,0)
and (0,0)
are within the circle that centered at (0,0)
and has radius 1. Now given the centers and radius of the three circles, please find the number of points (x,y)
where both x
, and y
are integers, that are within odd number of circles. Note that the circles can overlap arbitrarily, however, the radius is no more than 10. As a result you must be careful about how to test points, so that your program will run fast, and without doing unnecessary testing.
Input format
The first line of the input is the number of input cases. Each input case has three lines and each line has the x
, y
, coordinates of a circle, followed by the radius. The radius is no more than 10.
Output format
For each test case output the number of points (x,y)
where both x
, and y
are integers, that are within odd number of circles.
