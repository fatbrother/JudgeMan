Task Description
Write a program to factorize a polynomial. We will be given a polynomial f(x)=x3+ax2+bx+c
, where all a,b,c
are all integers between -100000 and 100000. Now we want to factorize f(x)
as (x+d)(x+e)(x+f)
, where d
, e
, and f
are all integers, and d≤e≤f
.
Input
A line containing a
, b
, and c
.
Output
A line containing d
, e
, and f
.
Sample input
12 47 60
