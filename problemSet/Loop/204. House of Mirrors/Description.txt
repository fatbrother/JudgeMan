Task Description
This exercise 6.10 in the textbook.
We have a room with a lot of mirrors. The rectangular room is of size W by D. You can think of the room consists of WD square cells, each is of unit length. Within each cell we may place a mirror. The mirror is two sided so that both sides reflect light. Now there are 2(W+D) windows around the room, each is centered at one of boundary cells, Like in the following figure. If we stand at window 0 and look into the room, we will see the person standing at window 8. Now write a program that, given the position of these windows, calculates the windows number we would be able to see if we stand at a particular window.

Input
The first line of the input has two numbers, W and D, representing the width and the depth of the room. Both D and W are positive integers and no more than 100. Each of the next D lines has W numbers, with 1 representing a mirror, and 0 for no mirror. The numbers are from top to bottom, left to right.
Output
The output has 2(W+D) lines, and each line has one number. The number in the i-th line indicates the window number that can be seen from the i-th window.
