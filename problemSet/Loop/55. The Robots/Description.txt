Task Description
Write a program to predict the fate of two robots. Suppose we have two robots running in an M
(horizontal) by N
(vertical) unit grid. Both will move at the speed of one square per time step. The first robot carries F1
amount of fuel and the second robot carries F2
. If a robot runs out of fuel, it will stop at that square. Moving to a new square requires one unit of fuel. During the first N1
time steps, the first robot R1
will move to the north; then, it will move towards the east during the next E1
time steps. The first robot will repeat this pattern until it runs out of fuel. The second robot R2
will move a little bit differently. During the first E2
time steps, the second robot R2
will move to the east; then, it will move towards the north during the next N2
time steps. Again the second robot will repeat this pattern until it runs out of fuel. If either robot moves "out of bound," it will "wrap around" and reappear (by sort of magic) on the other side of the field. For example, if M=7
and N=6
and a robot at (5,5)
goes north, it will reappear at (5,0)
. In addition, if two robots move into the same square, they explode. Now given the starting position of the first robot at (X1,Y1)
, and the second robot at (X2,Y2)
, and the amount of fuel they carry (F1
and F2
), determine whether the two robots will explode or not.
Input
There is only one line of inputs that contains M,;N,;X1,;Y1,;E1,;N1,;F1,;X2,;Y2,;E2,;N2,;F2
, with the following constraints.
0<N,;M<10000
0≤X1,;X2<M
0≤Y1,;Y2<N
(X1,Y1) is not (X2,Y2)
0<N1,;E1,;N2,;E2
0≤F1,;F2≤10000
Output
There are two cases of output. If two robots explode, output robots explode at time T, where T
is the time they explode. Otherwise, output robots will not explode.
Sample input
7 6 2 0 9 2 100 3 5 2 7 100
Sample output
robots explode at time 5
Sample input
7 6 2 0 9 2 6 3 5 2 7 0
Sample output
robots will not explode

我知道我們屬於不同的世界. 我們追尋不同的方向. 我們依循不同的週期. 但是, 如果我願意用一輩子的時間等待. 那麼, 在我燈枯油盡之前. 我們是否能有 相逢的一天?
