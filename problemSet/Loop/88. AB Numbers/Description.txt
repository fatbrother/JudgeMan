Task Description
Determine the A and B values for two input numbers. You have two numbers, each consisting of 4 different digits from 1 to 9. You should determine two values. The A value is the number of digits that are the same and appear in the same locations. For example, the A value of 1234 and 1253 is two since both 1 and 2 are the same and appear in the same locations. The B value is the number of digits that are the same but appear in different locations. For example, the B value of 1234 and 1253 is 1, since 3 appears in both numbers but appears in different locations.
Input Format
Two numbers in a line to determine the A and B values. Both numbers consist of 4 different non-zero digits.
Output Format
A single string of n A m B where n is the A value and m is the B value determined for the input.
