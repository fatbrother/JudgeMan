Task Description
編寫一個排版程式。程式必須將輸入的字逐一讀入，再逐一輸出。一個字的定義是「連續非空白的字元」，例如 7、empire. 都算是字。也就是說我們可以用 scanf("%s", string) 讀入一個字。
Input
輸入的第一行是每行可輸出的字元數 m
，之後就是要排版的文章，每個英文字的最大長度為 256 個字元，輸入請讀取到 EOF 結束。
Output
輸出請將所有的字依序印出，兩個字之間要以至少一個空格隔開。我們的目標是要利用最少且盡量平均分配的空格使得每一行輸出恰好 m
個字元(包含空白，不包含換行)。也就是我們要盡量把字放在同一行，而當我們必須要開新的一行時，若原本的那行字串+空白的長度不足 m
，我們要在字之間補上更多的空白。如果空格無法平均分配，則多的空格必須加在前面的字後面。行尾請勿有多的空白，也請勿少空白。最後一行輸出後必須換行。
Limits
32≤m≤256
，每個字串的字元數保證不會超過 m
個 。

The Declaration of Independence
was a statement adopted by the
Continental Congress on July 4,
1776, which announced that the
thirteen
American colonies then at war with
Great Britain regarded themselves as
independent
states, and no longer a part of the British
Empire.
Written primarily by Thomas Jefferson,
the Declaration was a formal explanation of why Congress had
voted on July 2 to declare
independence from Great Britain, more than
a year
after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.
The birthday of the United States
of America-Independence Day-is celebrated on
July 4, the day
the wording of the Declaration was approved
by Congress.
